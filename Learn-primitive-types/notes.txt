1/ INTRO

- TypeScript is an open-source language which is builds on JavaScripts

- Why is it considered as a super set of JavaScripts? It takes JS and add more features to it, meaning existing JS programs are also valid TS programs

- Developed and maintained by Microsoft

- Attributes
  + Validate if your code is woring properly
  + Writing Types is Optional
  + Client and Sever-side development
  + Transcompile to JavaScripts
  ! Browsers cannot compile TS 

- Pros: help code to have less errors, to be cleaner and more readable; it is optional, both sides development, no need for pseudocode

- The only con like SASS: needs to be compiled to JavaScript
